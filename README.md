# MoviesWebCRUDBoot
Spring Boot based Web site demo with CrudRepository support, running on embedded Tomcat 8 with Thymeleaf for Web UI

This is a demonstration project on Spring Boot development. It involves:

MySQL as a database with Spring CrudRepository support, Spring Tools Suite as IDE, Tomcat 8 as embedded container

moviesBootDB.sql was used to generate the MySql database used in this project.

This project can run on embedded Tomcat 8 from STS or standalone from a fat .jar file. It requires Java 8 Runtime Environment.

This is the Spring Boot reengineered version of a previous project based on Spring MVC only. 

The original project can be found on the repository:
